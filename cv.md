## Summary:  
I moved to Front-end development from another professional field
(Architecture and Construction engineer, management),
so I got all my knowledge to start from scratch independently.
I got my basic knowledge of HTML/CSS at the [HTML Academy](https://htmlacademy.ru/profile/amidawolf).
Continuing to work on the main specialty, I was doing small orders as a freelancer.

A year later, I found out about the [RS-School](https://rs.school/) and passed a full course
(advanced JS, advanced React). After that,
I continued to self-study and fulfill orders for freelancing.
I am constantly looking for new knowledge, strive for development and get great pleasure from it.

Right now I plan to start working full time on the frontend only.
A total reboot of career and life, something like that.
I like to do what benefits people, what makes them better or just have fun.
I think this is the main thing in my work.
